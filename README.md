 A team project to create a mouse capable of monitioring vitals.

If you would like to execute the program without installing the libraries, open the folder called dist, and run the mainwinow.exe contained within it

The first time you run it, you cannot use analysis until you have generated some data, so click start live

Any data will be stored in vitalsmouse_userdata. 
If you would like a bigger range of data to play around with, try moving the provided userdata folder from the UI folder to the dist folder
